# Performance-Report
Dynamic Performance Report Project for a Cosmetics Company Over Two Years
Introduction: This project aims to develop a comprehensive dynamic performance report for a cosmetics company using advanced data analysis tools in Excel and Power BI. The focus of the project is on analyzing the companyâ€™s financial and sales performance over a two-year period, with particular attention to key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, quantity sold, and gross profit. The goal is to create interactive reports that provide actionable insights into product performance, customer demographics, and regional sales, facilitating better decision-making.

Project Overview:

Data Preparation and Cleaning:

The data was cleaned by removing duplicates to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
Column formulas were corrected to avoid calculation errors and ensure proper formatting.
A new dim_date column was created to correctly link data to time periods, enabling time-based performance tracking.
Tables Used:

Plant Fact Table: Contains sales invoice data, including sales details and quantities sold.
Account Table: Includes customer information, such as country, street address, and other account-related details.
Plant Hierarchy Table: Includes product details, such as product family, product group, and product name.
Key Measures:

Measure Sales: Calculates the total sales.
Measure Quantity: Calculates the total quantity sold.
Measure Gross Profit: Calculates the total gross profit from sales.
YTD Sales, YTD Quantity, YTD Gross Profit: Measures the performance from the start of the year up to the current date.
PYTD Sales, PYTD Quantity, PYTD Gross Profit: Measures the same metrics for the previous year.
YTD vs PYTD: Compares the current year's performance with the previous year's performance.
Data Table Relationships:

The three tables (Plant Fact, Account, and Plant Hierarchy) were linked using common columns, such as customer ID and product ID, to ensure data integration and accurate analysis.
Interactive Dashboards and Visualizations:

Multiple charts were created (bar charts, pie charts, and time series) to display the different measures such as sales, quantity sold, and gross profit.
Interactive slicers were used to allow users to filter data by time periods (such as months or quarters) or by product categories (such as product family or group), providing flexibility in data exploration.
Results and Analysis:

The report offers detailed insights into the company's business performance, comparing key metrics for the current year with the previous year.
Users can interact with the report by selecting specific time periods or products, helping to identify trends and opportunities for improvement.
Objective: The objective of this project is to provide management with powerful analytical tools to better understand their financial and commercial performance. Through these dynamic reports, the company can identify its most profitable products, detect seasonal trends in sales, and analyze profitability by region or product category.

Conclusion:
This report was built using advanced analysis tools in Excel and Power BI to analyze the financial and sales data of a cosmetics company, focusing on key metrics that allow for a comprehensive evaluation of performance. The dynamic nature of the report ensures that management can make informed decisions based on real-time data insights.
